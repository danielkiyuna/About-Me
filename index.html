        <p>
            My main focus is to deliver applications that help offer guidance and solutions for the finance industry. I
            have a strong interest in building applications and websites specifically working the full stack.
            I have participated in virtual boot camps, conferences, and talks that are connected to businesses, coding,
            and the world of technology and finance.
            In my personal time, I work on projects that vary from websites to computer programs to iOS applications. My
            programming skills come from personal projects, self teaching, and online certifications.
            Zealous to learn new and challenging technologies specifically in finance!
